# Partnership Proposal: Florida Medical & Airport Transportation Alliance

**Prepared by:** LinkMia Transportation Services
**Prepared for:** [Tampa Partner Name]
**Date:** December 2024
**Status:** Draft for Discussion

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a strategic partnership between LinkMia (Miami-based airport and ground transportation) and [Tampa Partner] (established NEMT provider) to create a combined Florida transportation operation.

**The Opportunity:**
By combining [Tampa Partner]'s regulatory credentials and healthcare relationships with LinkMia's technology platform, we can expand service territories, reduce operational costs, and build a scalable Florida-wide transportation business.

**Proposed Structure:**
A revenue-sharing partnership where each party contributes their core strengths - credentials and compliance infrastructure from Tampa, technology and Miami operations from LinkMia.

**Projected Outcome:**
- Immediate Miami NEMT market entry (bypassing 6+ months of credentialing)
- 30-50% reduction in per-trip operational costs through technology
- Combined revenue potential of $25,000-50,000/month within Year 1
- Foundation for Florida-wide expansion

## The Market Opportunity

### Florida NEMT Market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Florida Medicaid enrollees | 5.4+ million |
| Annual NEMT trips statewide | 10+ million |
| Average reimbursement/trip | $22-35 |
| Market size | $300+ million annually |
| Growth rate | 8-12% per year |

### Why Partnership Makes Sense

**The Credentialing Barrier:**
- Medicaid broker credentialing: 3-6 months
- AHCA licensing: 60-90 days
- Commercial insurance setup: $8,000-15,000/year
- DOT compliance program: $2,000-5,000 setup
- **Total time to market alone: 6-9 months**

**The Technology Gap:**
- Most NEMT operators use outdated dispatch systems
- Manual booking processes lose customers
- Paper-based billing delays payments
- No customer self-service options
- **Result: Higher costs, lower customer satisfaction**

**Together:** Your credentials + Our technology = Market advantage

## Proposed Partnership Structures

### Option A: Subcontractor Model (Simplest)

```
Structure:
├── [Tampa Partner] remains sole legal entity
├── LinkMia operates as subcontractor in Miami
├── All trips billed through Tampa Partner's credentials
├── Tampa Partner handles all compliance
└── Revenue share based on Miami-generated trips

Pros:
├── Fastest to implement (2-4 weeks)
├── No new legal entities
├── Clear liability structure
└── Easy to unwind if needed

Cons:
├── LinkMia has less autonomy
├── All risk on Tampa Partner
└── Less equity building for LinkMia
```

**Suggested Revenue Split:**
- Miami NEMT trips: 65% LinkMia / 35% Tampa Partner
- Tampa trips (if any referred): 35% LinkMia / 65% Tampa Partner
- Airport trips (LinkMia's core): 100% LinkMia

---

### Option B: Joint Venture LLC (Balanced)

```
Structure:
├── Form new LLC: "Florida Medical Transport LLC" (or similar)
├── Both parties as members
├── LLC holds contracts and credentials
├── Each party operates their territory
└── Shared back-office (insurance, compliance, tech)

Pros:
├── Both parties build equity
├── Shared risk and reward
├── Cleaner for future growth
├── Professional structure for contracts
└── Easier to add future partners

Cons:
├── Legal setup costs ($2,000-5,000)
├── More complex accounting
├── Requires operating agreement
└── Slower to implement (4-6 weeks)
```

**Suggested Ownership Split:**
- Tampa Partner: 50% (credentials + existing business)
- LinkMia: 50% (technology + new market)

**Or value-weighted:**
- Tampa Partner: 40% (credentials valued at ~$20K)
- LinkMia: 60% (technology valued at ~$30K + Miami ops)

---

### Option C: Licensing + Revenue Share (Hybrid)

```
Structure:
├── Tampa Partner licenses LinkMia platform
├── Tampa Partner adds Miami as service territory
├── LinkMia manages Miami operations
├── Platform fee + revenue share model
└── Each party maintains independence

Pros:
├── Maximum flexibility
├── Clear separation of responsibilities
├── Scalable to other partners
└── Lower commitment initially

Cons:
├── More complex agreement
├── Less aligned incentives
├── May feel transactional
```

**Suggested Terms:**
- Platform license: $500/month (or waived for family)
- Revenue share on Miami NEMT: 60% LinkMia / 40% Tampa Partner
- Revenue share on Tampa trips using platform: 85% Tampa / 15% LinkMia

---

## Recommended Structure: Option B (Joint Venture)

For a family partnership with long-term growth potential, the Joint Venture model provides:

1. **Aligned incentives** - Both parties succeed together
2. **Professional structure** - For broker and clinic contracts
3. **Scalability** - Can add Orlando, Jacksonville as territories
4. **Exit clarity** - Clear ownership if circumstances change
