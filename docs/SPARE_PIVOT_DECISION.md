# PIVOT: Spare Labs is NOT Viable for LinkMia

> **Research Date**: December 2024
> **Previous Recommendation**: Use Spare Labs
> **NEW Recommendation**: Use Moovs ($199/mo) or Limo Anywhere ($99/mo)

## The Critical Finding

| What We Thought | What We Learned |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Spare might have startup pricing | **Minimum ~$50K/year** |
| Spare is for any fleet | **Spare is for municipal transit agencies** |
| We'd be a Spare customer | **We should be a Spare VENDOR instead** |

---

## Why Spare Labs Doesn't Fit LinkMia

### 1. Economics Don't Work

| Metric | Spare Labs | LinkMia Reality |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Setup fee | $12,000+ | Our entire vehicle deposit |
| Monthly cost | $2,500-10,000/mo | More than our revenue |
| Year 1 TCO | $50,000+ | 44% of projected revenue |
| Target customer | Transit agencies with federal grants | Private startups |

### 2. Wrong Features for Airport Transfers

| Spare Optimizes For | LinkMia Needs |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Pooling passengers together | **Exclusive rides** |
| Maximizing vehicle utilization | **Maximizing punctuality** |
| ADA compliance & NTD reporting | **Flight tracking** |
| Dynamic shared routing | **Direct A→B routes** |
| Public transit integration | **Corporate invoicing** |

**Key Insight**: If Spare's algorithm adds a second passenger to "optimize" the route, and that makes your VIP miss their flight - that's a service failure for LinkMia but an algorithmic success for Spare.

### 3. Venture-Backed Enterprise Sales Model

Spare raised $42M Series B targeting government contracts. Their minimum viable contract must justify enterprise sales costs:
- 6-18 month sales cycles
- RFP response teams
- $100K+ deals minimum

A 3-car startup doesn't register on their radar.

## The "Trojan Horse" Strategy

**Plot Twist**: Don't BUY from Spare - SELL to Spare's customers.

### How It Works

```
Miami-Dade Transit uses Spare Labs
            │
            │ "Open Fleets" overflow
            ▼
    ┌───────────────┐
    │   LinkMia     │  ← Receive trips during slow hours
    │  (as vendor)  │  ← Use their driver app (FREE)
    └───────────────┘  ← Get paid per trip
```

### The Opportunity

1. Miami-Dade Transit adopts microtransit (likely using Spare/Via)
2. When their buses are full, they dispatch overflow to "Open Fleets"
3. LinkMia registers as a local vendor/DBE
4. LinkMia receives trip requests during dead hours (10am-2pm, late night)
5. **Spare becomes a revenue source, not a cost**

### Action Items

- [ ] Contact Miami-Dade Transit procurement
- [ ] Register as DBE (Disadvantaged Business Enterprise)
- [ ] Apply to be an Open Fleets vendor
- [ ] Use "Spare Driver" app (free for vendors) for overflow trips

---

## Updated Strategic Principles

### Before (Wrong)
> "Use Spare for dispatch, prove demand, then maybe build custom"

### After (Correct)
> "Use Moovs for dispatch ($199/mo), prove demand, SELL to Spare's customers for extra revenue"
