## 📝 README Files Added

Each directory now has a README explaining:
- What belongs there
- What doesn't belong there
- Guidelines for usage

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Structure Created** - All directories ready
✅ **Documentation Added** - READMEs in place
✅ **Non-Breaking** - No files moved yet
✅ **Ready for Migration** - Can start moving files

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now we can start migrating files in phases:

### Phase 1: Documentation & Reports (Safe)
- Move *.md files → `docs/`
- No code dependencies

### Phase 2: Development Files (Safe)
- Move admin tools → `dev/admin/`
- Move templates → `dev/templates/`
- Move archive → `dev/archive/`

### Phase 3: Configuration (Easy)
- Move config files → `config/`
- Update paths in configs

### Phase 4: Backend (Moderate)
- Move API proxy → `backend/api-proxy/`
- Move functions → `backend/functions/`

### Phase 5: Frontend Assets (Careful)
- Move CSS → `src/assets/css/`
- Move images → `src/assets/images/`
- Move JS → `src/js/`
- Update all references

## ✨ Benefits Already Achieved

1. **Clear Organization** - Structure is self-documenting
2. **Ready for Growth** - New files have clear homes
3. **Team Ready** - Any developer understands the structure
4. **No Risk** - Application still works perfectly
