- Are there ANY per-trip fees or hidden costs?
- What happens if we exceed 250 trips? Overage pricing?

to receive overflow trips from Miami-area transit agencies using Spare Labs,

overflow trips from transit agencies that use Spare.

- How/when vendors get paid?
- Trip volume available per day?

### 6. Technology
- Which driver app required?
- Is Spare Driver app free for vendors?
- Can you set availability windows?
- Decline trips when busy with airport runs?

## LinkMia Context
- Vehicles: Sedan, SUV, Sprinter

## Why This Research Matters

| Path | Monthly Cost | Monthly Revenue | Net |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| Spare as Customer | -$2,500+ | $0 | -$2,500 |
| Moovs as Customer | -$199 | $0 | -$199 |
| Open Fleets as Vendor | $0 | +$1,500-2,500 | +$2,000 |

**Best case**: Use Moovs (-$199) AND be Open Fleets vendor (+$2,000) = **+$1,800/month**

## After Research: Decision Matrix

| Question | Answer Needed |
|----------|---------------|
| Is Moovs legit? | Confirm pricing, features, reviews |
| Does Miami-Dade use Open Fleets? | Yes → pursue vendor registration |
| Can we do both? | Moovs for airports + Spare for overflow |
| What's the registration effort? | Worth it if >$1K/month potential |
