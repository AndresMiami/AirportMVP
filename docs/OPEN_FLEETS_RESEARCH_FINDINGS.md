## Opportunity #1: UZURV (Palm Beach) ⭐ START HERE

### What It Is
Palm Tran (Palm Beach County) has officially contracted with **UZURV** to handle overflow trips. UZURV is a specialized TNC for ADA/NEMT compliance.

### Why It's Perfect for LinkMia
- **Plug and play** - just sign up at uzurv.com/drive
- **No government contract needed** - UZURV handles the agency relationship
- **Covers PBI airport area** - you're already servicing this zone
- **Higher pay than Uber/Lyft** - $25-35/trip average

### Requirements
| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Vehicle age | 2016 or newer (rolling 10-year) |
| Vehicle condition | No salvage titles, clean interior, working A/C |
| Insurance | UZURV provides $1M coverage while on trip |
| Drug test | FTA-compliant pre-employment screening |
| Background check | Standard |

### Action Steps
1. Go to uzurv.com/drive
2. Upload vehicle documents
3. Complete driver screening
4. Pass FTA drug test
5. Start receiving Palm Tran overflow trips

### Timeline: 2-4 weeks

---

## Opportunity #2: Rider's Choice (Broward)

### What It Is
A **payment subsidy program** where eligible TOPS riders get a card. They can use authorized providers for same-day trips. County subsidizes up to **$30/trip**.

### Why It's Clever
- **Not a government contract** - it's B2C with B2B subsidy
- **Immediate cash flow** - no "net 30" waiting
- **You keep the full meter** - part from card, part from passenger
- **Covers FLL airport area**

### Requirements
| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Operating Permit | Taxi or Luxury Sedan permit from Broward Consumer Protection |
| Chauffeur Registration | Required for every driver (~$170 total) |
| Background check | Fingerprint-based (FDLE/FBI) |
| Drug screening | Required |

### The Chauffeur Registration Process
Every driver needs a "Hack License":
1. Fingerprint-based criminal background (FDLE/FBI)
2. Florida driving record check
3. Drug screening
4. Read/write English
5. Fee: ~$80 application + ~$90 fingerprinting

### Timeline: 4-6 weeks

---

## Opportunity #3: Via Fleet Partner (Miami-Dade)

### What It Is
Via operates **MetroConnect** (Miami's microtransit). They use "Fleet Partners" - local companies that supply vehicles and drivers.

### How It Works
- LinkMia supplies cars + drivers
- Via supplies dispatch + branding (MetroConnect wraps)
- Via pays LinkMia a contracted rate
- Drivers use Via Driver App

### The Catch: CPCN Required
To operate commercially in Miami-Dade, you need a **Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity**:
- Formal application to DTPW
- Background check on corporate officers
- **Public hearing + County Commission vote**
- Vehicle inspections
- Timeline: **3-6 months**

### Insurance Reality
Miami is a high-litigation market:
- Minimum: $300,000 CSL
- Often required: $500,000 - $1,000,000
- Cost: **$5,000-9,000 per vehicle per year**

### Timeline: 3-6 months (after CPCN)

---

## Opportunity #4: NEMT Brokers (Medicaid)

### What It Is
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation funded by Medicaid. Brokers (Alivi, Modivcare) dispatch trips to credentialed providers.

### Payment Rates
| Component | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Ambulatory pickup | $15-25 |
| Per loaded mile | $2-3 |
| Wait time | Often capped/unpaid |

### How to Credential

**Alivi (Sunshine Health)**
- Portal: alivi.com/providers
- Requires: NPI, Commercial Insurance ($300K+), Tax ID

**Modivcare**
- Physical facility/vehicle inspection required
- Drivers need PASS certification

### Volume vs. Margin
- High volume available
- Lower margin than airport transfers
- Best used to **fill dead time**

### Timeline: 2-4 months

---

## Opportunity #5: Transportation America Subcontractor

### What It Is
Transportation America holds the **Master Contract** for Miami-Dade STS (5,400+ daily trips). They use subcontractors for overflow.

### The Reality
- "Registering with Miami-Dade" = registering with Transportation America
- County doesn't dispatch to small independents directly
- You're a sub-sub-contractor

### Payment Rate
| Who | Rate |
|-----|------|
| County pays TA | ~$26/ambulatory trip |
| TA pays subs | ~$18-22/trip (70-80%) |

### Requirements
- Miami-Dade CPCN (required)
- Vehicle age limits
- PASS driver certification
- Insurance matching county standards

### Timeline: 4-6 months (relationship building)

## Summary: Why This Works

| **Zero software cost** | Agencies pay for Spare/Via, you use their driver app FREE |
| **Fill dead time** | Overflow trips between airport runs |
| **Diversified revenue** | Not 100% dependent on airport bookings |
| **Regulatory moat** | CPCN/licenses protect from competition |
| **Stacks with Moovs** | Use Moovs for airports, UZURV/Via apps for overflow |
